# Adam-Sandler-Tribute-Page
<p>FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Projects - Tribute Page</p>
<p>This is the second project of the Responsive Web Design Certification in Free Code Camp. The objective of this challenge was to build a tribute page that meets the 9 user stories specified by Free Code Camp. I decided to do my project on Adam Sandler, my favorite actor. Since my tribute page is devoted to an actor, I decided to include a Youtube Video, even though that was not required by the project. I also did my best to make my page attractive and responsive at multiple screen sizes.</p>
<p>More information on the project and its requirements can be found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-survey-form-project/build-a-survey-form">here</a>. I have also posted my survey form on Codepen, which you can see <a href="https://codepen.io/TurtleQueenCoding/pen/WNMoMoa">here</a>.
